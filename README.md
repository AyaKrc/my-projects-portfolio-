# üî§ English ‚Üî Darija (Moroccan Arabic) Neural Machine Translation 

**Description:** Built a low-resource English‚ÄìDarija translation pipeline: cleaned a noisy parallel corpus, filled missing English sentences via back-translation, then trained a custom seq2seq LSTM (with a peephole variant) and ran a small hyper-parameter study.

**Problem:** Public Darija‚ÄìEnglish datasets are small and very incomplete (‚âà85% of the eng side missing in the sentences split). Dropping those rows would destroy supervision, so we first recover the English side before modeling.

**Data:** Hugging Face imomayiz/darija-english (config: sentences) with darija (Latin), darija_ar (Arabic script), and eng; most eng entries are missing.

**Approach:** EDA + missing-value audit ‚Üí back-translation of darija_ar using ychafiqui/darija-to-english-2 ( Transformers) with batching & checkpointing; split the missing set into 5 parts for parallel runs, then recombined.

**Preprocessing:** Lowercasing + punctuation strip; word-level tokenization (NLTK); vocab with special tokens (<PAD>, <SOS>, <EOS>, <UNK>); index + pad; build train/val/test loaders (80/10/10).

**Models:** Baseline seq2seq LSTM encoder‚Äìdecoder (PyTorch) and an advanced variant with a custom LSTM Peephole cell; Seq2Seq forward with teacher forcing; metrics: token-level cross-entropy and validation accuracy.

**Tech stack:** PyTorch, Transformers (HF), datasets (HF), NLTK, pandas, tqdm, matplotlib.
