## üéì Academic Projects  

### üéß Audio Compression System ‚Äî *IRM Custom Audio Format*  

![IRM Audio Compression Interface](./Image1.png)  
*Interface of the application allowing users to select audio files and apply the IRM compression algorithm.*  

![Compression Result Example](./image.png)  
*Output showcasing compression results, file size reduction, and comparison with standard formats.*  

**Description:**  
Designed a custom audio compression system named **IRM**, combining **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** for multi-resolution analysis with the **Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)** algorithm for data reduction.  
The project integrates a user-friendly interface to apply, visualize, and compare compression results with common formats like WAV and OGG.  

**Key Features:**  
- Multi-resolution signal analysis with DWT  
- Entropy-based data compression using LZW  
- Compression/decompression process with quality retention  
- GUI-based interaction for audio processing  

**Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Tkinter
